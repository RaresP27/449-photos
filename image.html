    <section><h2>The location and significance of the image</h2>
    <p>
        This image was taken in the Bucegi Mountains situated almost in the middle of Romania where one side of 
        this natural rock formation appears to be forming the head of a sphinx. A totally natural phenomenon
        this unique work of nature attracts tens of thousands of tourists annually. This just goes to show
        that there are so many natural wonders out there that most people have never even heard of, or 
        have ever seen.
